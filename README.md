## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the index.html file in the browser.

#index
This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. Within the body, there are four sections that are added to begin with. Right now, there is simply filler text here but this can be easily fixed in the future. Note the id, class, and data-nav variables and how they are used. This will come into play later on when we create an interactive site.

## Running
To launch this website, simply open the index.html file in the browser.
